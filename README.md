# hamjest-dom-matchers

Matchers for use with Hamjest and DOM trees.

## Why?

Because [Hamjest](https://github.com/rluba/hamjest) provides a great framework for writing customer matchers in Javacript that leaves tests clean, readable and maintainable over time.

Dealing with XML is annoying but if you have to to do it, being able to TDD tests quickly is a must. By no means extensive, the matchers so far facilitated TDD'ing tests for a SOAP based project that used `xmldom` and `xpath` to parse and extract data.

See the tests for examples of how to use the Matchers. 

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install hamjest-dom-matchers --save-dev
```
